> ###Things you probably want to know
>  1. 1.PowerToCSS is not, nor is trying to be a "Swiss-Knife". With PowerToCSS, with PowerToCSS we just want to provide a solid CSS base so developers can jump-start any project based in good practices.
>  2. 2.PowerToCSS consist in 2 files: the **core** css file wich is powertocss.css and the **theme** wich is standard-theme.css. While powertocss.css has the base and the core styles, standard-theme.css has the custom styles
>  3. 3.You should **never modify** the core file wich is **powertocss.css**
>  4. 4.Customizations and **modifications are done** in **standard-theme.css**
>  5. 5.PowerToCSS is NOT a Rival of the existing solutions, but an Alternative.
